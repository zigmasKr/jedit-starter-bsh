# jEdit macro 'starter'
Macro 'starter' for jEdit is written in BeanShell.
The earlier implementation was in Javascript (Nashorn).
It is an interface to file browsing, selecting, opening, reading in my working environment (Windows 10).
Work started on 2017-01-03 with a launcher of the Perl script articledata.pl.
The main work is done here within that Perl script.
Next step was in 2018-07 when a tool for QC procedures was created on a new tab.
This tool demonstrates the use of zip (unzip *.bz2 files in a tree), Adobe PDF reader, 
jEdit, and its plugin JDiff on a number of files.
